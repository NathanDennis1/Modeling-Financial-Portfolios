## Project: Large Financial Managers â€“ Understanding Portfolio Compositions via SEC Form 13F Data

### Group Members

- **Aditya Saxena** - [adityasaxena@g.harvard.edu](mailto:adityasaxena@g.harvard.edu)

### Background and Motivation
The SEC Form 13F, filed quarterly by institutional investors, increases public visibility of their equity holdings. This project aims to analyze these filings from Q2 2013 to Q3 2024 to gain insights into the holdings and strategies of large institutional investors like hedge funds, which typically operate with limited transparency. Examining these quarterly holdings may reveal cross-sectional and time-series trends at both firm and market levels.

### Data
The project will use the Form 13F data, available through the SEC's EDGAR system. This dataset includes filing details such as submission types, filing dates, issuer names, CUSIP numbers, and market values. Despite its relevance in capturing large-scale investment activities, the dataset may contain errors or inconsistencies due to self-reported data. These challenges will be addressed during the EDA phase, with a focus on handling missing or incorrect entries.

### Scope
The project will begin with exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in institutional holdings. This includes cross-sectional analysis comparing portfolio compositions across institutions each quarter and time-series analysis to observe changes over time. Planned methods include linear regression to model relationships and clustering to group similar strategies. This project offers hands-on experience with data cleaning, analysis, and modeling, enhancing our understanding of institutional investment behaviors.
